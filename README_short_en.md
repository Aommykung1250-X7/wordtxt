**🕐 0:00–0:30 | Introduction**

(A): Hey guys, have you noticed how the air feels kind of heavy lately?

(B): Yeah, it’s been really hazy. I heard it’s because of PM2.5 dust.

(C): That’s right. It’s a big problem, especially in cities like ours.

(D): I saw the air quality index online. It’s been in the red zone for days! It’s worrying.

**🕐 0:30–1:30 | Cause**

(B): Do you know what’s causing all this PM2.5? It seems to get worse every year.

(C): Mostly burning stuff, like trash or crop fields. Farmers do it a lot after harvest, and it adds up

(C): and there are so many vehicles on the road. Car exhaust is a big part of the problem.

(D): factories release a lot of pollution too. Sometimes people ignore the rules and burn things anyway, which makes it harder to control.

**🕐 1:30–2:30 | Effect**

(D): All these causes really affect our health. People get coughs, allergies, even asthma.

(A): My cousin has trouble breathing when the air is like this. It’s tough for people with health issues.

(B): yeah, It’s not just about health, either. Tourism drops, and the city looks gloomy when the air is bad.

(B): I read that long-term exposure can even shorten your life. It’s a serious issue for everyone.

**🕐 2:30–3:30 | Solution**

(A): So, what can we do to fix it? There must be some ways to help.

(C): First, we should stop burning garbage and crop fields. It’s simple but effective if everyone cooperates.

(B): actually Using public transport more and reducing car use can also make a difference.

(D): There are cool inventions too, like air-purifying towers and billboards that clean the air. Technology can help us fight this problem.

**🕐 3:30–4:30 | Recommendation**

(A): I think the government should support clean energy and electric vehicles to reduce pollution.

(B): Yeah, and they should make stricter laws about burning and pollution, so people take it seriously.

(A): We can help by planting trees and spreading awareness in our communities.

(C): If everyone does their part, things will get better. It’s all about working together.

**🕐 4:30–5:00 | Conclusion**

(C): So, to wrap it up, PM2.5 is definitely a serious issue we can’t ignore.

(A): Yeah, but I believe if everyone helps — the government, communities, and us — we can totally make a change.

(D): Right. It might take time, but even small actions can make a big difference.

(A): Yeah, cleaner air means better health and better life!
